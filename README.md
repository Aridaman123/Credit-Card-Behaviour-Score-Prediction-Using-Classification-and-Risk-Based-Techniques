# 🎯 Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive credit risk assessment system that predicts the likelihood of credit card default for customers using advanced machine learning techniques. The solution empowers financial institutions to:

✅ Identify high-risk customers proactively
✅ Optimize credit policies based on data-driven insights
✅ Minimize financial losses through early intervention
✅ Improve portfolio health and risk management
# 🎯 Problem Statement
Credit card defaults cost financial institutions billions annually. This project tackles the challenge of predicting customer default behavior using historical payment patterns, demographic data, and financial indicators.
